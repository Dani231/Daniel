   	        <h1>What is Freeride Snowboarding?</h1>
   	        <p>If you’re asking the question “what is freeride snowboarding?” then I don’t blame you. The term does get very confused in the snowboarding world.
        <br>
        <br>
            Now I’m not going to claim that my definition of it is the right one – but I will offer you one definition – and I think it’s the best definition because it differentiates it as a riding style compared with all-mountain and freestyle.</p>

        	 <h1>Some other Definitions of Freeriding</h1>
        	 <p>Before I go into my definition I want to cover a couple of other freeriding definitions.
             <br>
             <br>
             The main one is lumping freeriding and all-mountain riding together. A lot of people essentially call freeriding and all-mountain riding the same thing.
             <br>
             <br>
             To me this is wrong – all mountain riding might involve some freeriding but will also involve other types of riding.
             <br>
             <br>
             The other misconception (in my opinion) is lumping freestyle and freeriding together as the same thing. Whilst you can incorporate some freestyle riding into your freeriding it isn’t the same thing. The almost opposite nature of freestyle snowboards and freeride snowboards backs this up.</p>

        	 <h1>My Definition of Freeride Snowboarding</h1>
        	 <p>Freeriding is all about charging hard.
             <br>
             <br>
             It’s built from riding various terrain in the backcountry. Whilst freeriding can be done on the groomers – it is much more “freeing” in the backcountry where there are less people to spoil your carves and more open terrain to explore and to press the limits in.</p>

             	<li>Hard carves</li>
             	<li>Steep slopes</li>
